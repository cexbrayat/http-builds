 * Creates `Response` instances from provided values.
 *
 * Though this object isn't
 * usually instantiated by end-users, it is the primary object interacted with when it comes time to
 * add data to a view.
 *
 * \@usageNotes
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * http.request('my-friends.txt').subscribe(response => this.friends = response.text());
 * ```
 *
 * The Response's interface is inspired by the Response constructor defined in the [Fetch
 * Spec](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response-class), but is considered a static value whose body
 * can be accessed many times. There are other differences in the implementation, but this is the
 * most significant.
